- 👋 Hi, I’m @sureshlazaruspaul, a data science whiz. This is public economic, gender, and health research code repo.  
- 👀 I’m interested in SQL, R programmming, and Python. If you want to bounce off some ideas on applications, reach me! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on public health, economics, and finance empirical research. Alternately, I have a lot of economic empirical templates that automate data mining, extraction, and handling from popular data sources (WHO, World Bank, MEPS, CMS, DHS, IHDS, CRSP/Compustat etc.). I will post a few of them here and you are free to use it (wholly or partially), but I'd appreciate a citation.
- 📫 How to reach me >> spaul@bw.edu
